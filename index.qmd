# Welcome {.unnumbered}

Welcome to [*The Researcher's Guide to N3C: A National Resource for Analyzing Real-World Health Data*](https://national-covid-cohort-collaborative.github.io/guide-to-n3c-v1/).
Here you will find guidance, information, and pointers to resources for conducting research with the [National COVID Cohort Collaborative](https://ncats.nih.gov/n3c) (N3C).

During a time of isolation and unanswered questions in an emerging pandemic, N3C was born of an urgent need to save lives. N3C was created “to acquire and harmonize data across organizations and [provide] a secure data environment to enable transparent and reproducible collaborative research.” ^[See <https://covid.cd2h.org/about>.] Dozens of technical, clinical, and regulatory experts from government agencies, healthcare organizations, academic institutions, and the private sector worked together to build the nation’s largest and most diverse set of de-identified health records to date. Today, thousands of researchers have actively engaged with N3C resulting in hundreds of scholarly products informing public policy and patient care.

N3C emphasizes community and team science values which are embodied by the structure of the organization and reflected in the following chapters. This guide originated as a project of the Education and Training Domain Team, one of the many self-organizing [teams](#sec-onboarding-dt) within N3C. An editorial committee was formed to engage with principal investigators, clinician-scientists, informaticians, data scientists, and others to condense the collective knowledge amassed in N3C. Chapters are authored and peer reviewed by a diverse group of contributors with both broad and deep domain expertise. This has been a work of heart and soul, designed to make this ground-breaking work accessible without obscuring its complexity.

N3C is continuously evolving, and we expect this book will as well. We invite you to join us in continually expanding and improving this guide, but most importantly, we invite you to get involved in one of the many avenues for impactful research that N3C provides.

Sincerely,

_The G2N3C Editorial Committee_

Contributing Content
------------------

The N3C and its [domain teams](https://covid.cd2h.org/domain-teams) are healthiest when assimilating contributions from reseachers of different skills (*e.g.*, clinicians & informaticians), specialties (*e.g.*, endocrinology & gerontology), programming languages (*e.g.*, Python, R, & SQL) and experiences (*e.g.*, students & PIs).

Accordingly, the [guide-to-n3c-v1](https://github.com/National-COVID-Cohort-Collaborative/guide-to-n3c-v1) repository welcomes input from you.

If you see a small mistake or unclear language, we invite you to inform us in a [new issue](https://github.com/National-COVID-Cohort-Collaborative/guide-to-n3c-v1/issues) or to edit the source and submitting a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).  When an editor reviews and accepts your change, the website will be updated within minutes.

If you have an idea for something more substantial such as a chapter or section, please start a [new issue](https://github.com/National-COVID-Cohort-Collaborative/guide-to-n3c-v1/issues) and the N3C Educational Committee will coordinate with you where it fits best.
