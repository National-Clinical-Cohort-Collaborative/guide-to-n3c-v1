Choosing the Right Tool for each part of the Project
==================

*likely chapter: ?*

To contribute to a project as an analyst, we recommend that you know basic SQL code.  As mentioend before {TODO: add cross-reference}, the N3C source tables are typically too large to be handled comfortable in Python and R, so we recommend using SQL or Spark (through a library like [PySpark](https://databricks.com/glossary/pyspark)).

SQL
---------

* [*Getting Started with SQL*](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Getting_Started_with_SQL/RHOOCwAAQBAJ) by Thomas Nield (2016), O'Reilly Media.

    Chapters 1-8 will help you write basic queries.  Chapter 9-11 will help you design and maintain conventional databases, but are not relevant to typical workkflows in Enclave.  It is written for SQLite, which is a different database engine than SparkSQL used in Enclave.  But almost all its syntax applies to Spark SQL; please see {TODO: add reference} for

Python
---------

R
---------

* [*R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickham & Garrett Grolemund (2016-2022), O'Reilly Media.
