A Research Story {#story}
=========================

> 50,000-foot view of a research project, from onboarding to publishing

Now that we have introduced N3C and described its motivation and importance, we'll walk through the lifecycle of an example project from onboarding to publishing.  This path typically takes at least 6 months and 6 collaborators.  It is difficult to do by yourself, but fortunately the N3C has attracted a large and diverse set of researchers.  Coupled with a large and diverse set of patients, it is possible to complete a research project within a year.

If you are starting a project by yourself, you'll likely be able to recruit a set of collaborators with a complementary set of skills (in addition to the resources such as [instructional material]() and [office hours]()).  If you would like to join an existing project, there are likely [domain teams](https://covid.cd2h.org/domain-teams) and ongoing projects that will fit your interests and benefit from your abilities.

Onboarding {#story-person}
----------------------------------------------

* {A person's paperwork.  Include ORCiD}
* {DUA coverage & An institution's paperwork.}
* {DUR & a project's paperwork.}

Team building & collaborating
----------------------------------------------

{Identifying & approaching potential collaborators}

Protocol, variables, & definitions
----------------------------------------------

This aspect of the scientific process is probably the most familiar to you, but is also the most vague and difficult to explain.  Several years of graduate-level courses and real-world experience are required...

{Mention CD2H's [Informatics Playbook](https://playbook.cd2h.org/en/latest/index.html)}

Learning and using OMOP (e.g. concept sets)
----------------------------------------------

{3-4 sentence description of the original OMOP motivation.  It standardizes (a) tables & columns and (b) vocabulary.  Spend 1-2 paragraphs on concept set, focusing more on motivations than the mechanics.}

Creating an analysis-ready dataset
----------------------------------------------

{Conventional data engineer role.  Dataset is created with input from the analyst.}

Analyses
----------------------------------------------

* Developing the Analyses
* finalizing analysis
  * Pinning to a release
  * DRR
  * figures

Draft paper, pub committee
----------------------------------------------
