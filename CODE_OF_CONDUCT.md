# N3C Community Guiding Principles

The N3C Community Guiding Principles document outlines expectations of every N3C community member, which includes, institutions and individuals who use N3C resources, expertise, and data. The N3C community is committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring environment for all community members. These principles were established by the N3C Community in an unprecedented effort to encourage and enable a highly collaborative research environment to address one of the worst health crises of our time. As such, we expect these guiding principles to be honored by each community member.
