Getting Started w/ N3C {#starting}
=============================================

{*This chapter is copied from a quick document we used internally when talking to new investigators.  The quality needs to be improved for this audience.  Please add/improve anything.*}

Registration
---------------------------------------------

1. For new investigators who want to access the [N3C Enclave](https://covid.cd2h.org/enclave), the first step is to register at <https://labs.cd2h.org/registration/> and log in using your institution's authentication information.  If your institution does not appear, please verify that your institution's data use agreement (DUA) is in place.  Email <NCATSPartnerships@mail.nih.gov> with questions.

1. Check the boxes for Enclave access and workstream access.

1. You will need to enter an ORCiD ID (if you don't have one, you must create one)..

1. Enter google info if you want to join the slack channels, access google drive resources, etc. (Slack and Google drive accounts are utilized frequently for info sharing on a national level, and we highly recommend providing this info if available.)

1. Registration and being added to the system may take a few days. You will need to complete the onboarding process (Review checklist here: <https://covid.cd2h.org/enclave-checklist>).

1. Be current on CITI training.

Data Use Request
---------------------------------------------

Once you are able to log in to the Enclave, to access data, you can request to be a collaborator on a current project or fill out a Data Use Request at <https://unite.nih.gov/workspace/slate/documents/data-use-request/latest>.

If your project requires zip codes or partial zip codes, you will be required to complete an IRB application and provide an approval letter.
