`snippets/`
======================

Use the `snippets/` directory to temporarily store files that likely will go into the book, but whose location hasn't yet been determined.  I'm hoping this directory will free authors to create content when they're inspired, instead of being paralyzed because they don't yet know the perfect location.

Once the material has been transferred to the book, move the snippet to the `snippets/incorporated/` directory.

I'm guessing this snippet system will work best when the files are fairly atomic.  In other words, its contents all hang together and are moved at once.  But let's be flexible if I'm wrong.
