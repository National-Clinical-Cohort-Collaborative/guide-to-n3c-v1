## How the Guide Came To Be {#sec-colophon-be}

While N3C leverages a variety of existing technologies, many of the tools, processes,
and organizational structures were developed for its unique needs, resulting in a
complex landscape for researchers to navigate. The idea for a comprehensive guide was
originally proposed in January 2022 by members of the Education and Training Domain Team,
with the first public release presented at the [May 2023 N3C Community Forum](https://youtu.be/WI8TuiQKCWM?si=4X9F4YHF3IBhdNUI&t=1893). Drawing inspiration
from the [Book of OHDSI](https://ohdsi.github.io/TheBookOfOhdsi/), its creation involved
many volunteers and required coordination across a wide variety of stakeholders,
contributors, and subject matterexperts. This chapter outlines the processes involved,
in the hope it may benefit others.

The *Guide* exists within a larger landscape of educational and training materials,
both from within the N3C community and the larger health data sciences oeuvre.
The overarching goal was the creation of a living textbook that serves as a single
entry point to engaging with the Enclave. As such, the development focused on
leveraging existing content, providing a cohesive information structure, and
filling in crucial gaps based on a learning community of users and stakeholders.


## Editorial Committee, Ideation, and Outlining {#sec-colophon-ed-committee-outlining}

Because N3C is a large consortium, project members first set out to establish an Editorial Committee representing a broad set of stakeholder groups and other teams. These included:

* [The Education and Training Domain Team](onboarding.md#sec-onboarding-dts)
* [Project Management and User Support](onboarding.md#sec-onboarding-team-role)
* [Data and Logic Liaisons](support.md#sec-support-liaisons)
* [Ingestion and Harmonization](cycle.md)
* [Governance](governance.md)
* The [Machine Learning](ml.md) Domain Team and [Applicable Data Methods and Standards](practices.md#sec-practices-overview) workstream
* Other clinical [domain teams](onboarding.md#sec-onboarding-dts)

Editorial Committee members were invited to maximize coverage of these groups
with an eye toward keeping the Committee small and efficient.

The Committee’s initial focus was 1) identifying audiences: current or potential
researchers primarily, and organizers of other large community efforts secondarily,
and 2) identifying the set of topics to be covered. To do so in an inclusive and
impartial manner, each Committee member independently generated a list of topics
for inclusion. These were then organized into thematic areas to highlight topics
of widespread interest as well as important niche subjects.

![A subset of organized topics proposed by editorial Committee members. Colors represent suggestions from different members. Each cluster was subsequently considered for inclusion and placement in a draft outline.](images/colophon/fig-colophon-010-topic-clouds.png){#fig-colophon-010-topic-clouds width=100% fig-alt="initial-topics-organized"}
Having compiled a set of topics, the Committee then created a preliminary outline,
which included chapter and subsection titles along with brief notes on the proposed
content. This outline was shared with the broader N3C community through mailing lists,
the Domain Team leads, and other communication channels to solicit feedback. Although
no significant changes or additions were suggested, the inclusion of several smaller
topics and minor reorganization helped to enhance the overall structure of the outline,
as well as generate community interest.

## Drafting Chapters {#sec-colophon-drafting-chapters}

### Roles and Responsibilities {#sec-colophon-roles-and-responsibilities}

For each chapter, one or more subject matter experts were invited to act as chapter
leads. Chapter leads were encouraged to recruit additional contributors as authors,
while primarily overseeing the development of chapter content. The Editorial
Committee was responsible for facilitating communication, organization, and
publication processes. They also ensured the coherence, quality, and suitability
of the final product, collaborating closely with chapter leads as necessary.

The Committee monitored chapter progress on a monthly basis, and organized writing
sessions, office hours, and communication channels to foster cross-chapter
discussions and address contributor questions.

### Content Guidance {#sec-colophon-content-guidance}

To ensure a consistent presentation and flow throughout the *Guide*, the Editorial
Committee created a guidance document for contributors offering style and technical advice, encouraging:

* Linking to external sources of truth when available
* Audience-focused content
* Prose over bulleted lists (except where appropriate)
* Ample use of high-resolution screenshots and examples
* Common elements like info-boxes
* References, cross-references, and footnotes
* Appropriate attribution
* Minimizing references to resources with restricted availability

This guidance also detailed the roles and responsibilities described above, and
provided links to the draft outline and other resources as a central information source for contributors.

### Technical Considerations {#sec-colophon-technical}

The Committee decided early in the project to publish via a technical stack based on
GitHub pages and the markdown-based [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) package. However, as many authors were
unfamiliar with these technologies, all draft content was initially created in Google
Docs to facilitate collaborative editing and ease of contribution. Each chapter team
was provided with a “stub” document linking to the guidance document, all
within an organized folder structure.

Contributors were required to upload high-resolution images following a suggested
file naming convention for eventual publication. They were also encouraged to include
cross-references between chapters, which was complicated by the parallel development of
chapter content across teams. Instead of linking directly to other sections,
contributors included ‘pseudo-links’ to anticipated chapters and subsections
indicated by the draft outline, which needed to be finalized during the publication process.

## Review and Publication {#sec-colophon-review-and-pub}

As each chapter was completed, the Committee designated three peer reviewers to
evaluate the content for accuracy and appropriateness. These reviews were openly
conducted within the Google Doc drafts using commenting and suggesting features.
Editorial Committee members frequently served as reviewers for many chapters
(excluding those they authored), but other subject matter experts were also engaged.

After reviews were completed content was migrated to GitHub and published in proof
form. While part of this process was automated, considerable manual effort was
required to curate references to external sources, cross-references between sections,
and other metadata. GitHub issues and checklists were used to track each chapters’
publication progress, in close collaboration with chapter leads.^[See this [checklist](https://github.com/national-clinical-cohort-collaborative/guide-to-n3c-v1/issues/138)
as one example within the [collection](https://github.com/national-clinical-cohort-collaborative/guide-to-n3c-v1/issues/58) of chapter checklists. Special thanks to Committee member Will Beasley for his
technical expertise and development of this publication workflow!]

As a living document, changes and new content are managed via [GitHub](https://github.com/national-clinical-cohort-collaborative/guide-to-n3c-v1),
with needs tracked via [issues](https://github.com/national-clinical-cohort-collaborative/guide-to-n3c-v1/issues?q=is%3Aissue). See the [How to Contribute](#sec-welcome-contribute) section for details.
